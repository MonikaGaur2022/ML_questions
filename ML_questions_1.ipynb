    "\n",
    "The General Linear Model (GLM) is a useful framework for comparing how several variables affect different continuous variables. GLM is the foundation for several statistical tests, including ANOVA, ANCOVA and regression analysis. GLM provides a way to model dependent variables that have non-normal distributions and allows for the incorporation of predictor variables that are not Normally distributed. The GLM allows us to summarize a wide variety of research outcomes. The generalized linear model(GLM) generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted valueÂ¹. \n"

The likelihood ratio test is a more powerful test than the p-value, but it is also more computationally demanding.

A large difference in the likelihoods indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true, and the predictor is therefore likely to be significant.\n",
